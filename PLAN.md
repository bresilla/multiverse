## Recent Changes Summary

### Point 4: Naming & Style (COMPLETED)
**All naming and style improvements have been successfully implemented:**

1. **Class and Variable Renaming:**
   - Fixed "Chasis" → "Chassis" throughout entire codebase
   - Renamed directories: `src/robot/chasis/` → `src/robot/chassis/`
   - Updated all file names, include paths, and references

2. **Member Variable Cleanup:**
   - Removed "z" suffix: `wheelz` → `wheels`, `controlz` → `controls`, `jointz` → `joints`
   - Fixed all related variables: `karosseriez` → `karosseries`, `hitchz` → `hitches`

3. **Case Convention Standardization:**
   - Standardized to **snake_case** throughout codebase
   - Fixed camelCase variables: `maxImpulse` → `max_impulse`, `wheelRadius` → `wheel_radius`
   - Updated function parameters: `linearDamping` → `linear_damping`

4. **Encapsulation Improvements:**
   - Made Wheel class data members private with proper accessors
   - Added `get_wheel()`, `get_position()`, `set_linear_damping()`, `set_angular_damping()` methods
   - Made Chassis class internal members private with getter methods

5. **Bug Fixes:**
   - Fixed typos: `pulsining` → `pulsing`, `get_karosseies` → `get_karosseries`
   - Corrected method names and variable references

6. **Const Correctness:**
   - Added const to getter methods: `get_corners()`, `get_grid_data()`
   - Changed string parameters to const references for efficiency
   - Added const overloads where appropriate

**Build Status:** ✅ **All changes compile successfully and maintain full functionality**

### Point 6.2: Project Name Consistency (COMPLETED)
**Resolved all naming inconsistencies between "flatsim" and "multiverse":**

1. **Namespace Standardization:**
   - Changed namespace from `mvs` to `fs` throughout entire codebase
   - Updated all `namespace mvs` → `namespace fs`
   - Updated all `mvs::` → `fs::` references
   - Updated `using namespace mvs` → `using namespace fs`

2. **Directory Structure:**
   - Renamed `include/multiverse/` → `include/flatsim/`
   - Updated all include paths: `#include "multiverse/..."` → `#include "flatsim/..."`
   - Maintained proper header organization and dependencies

3. **Application Names:**
   - Updated Rerun recording streams from "multiverse" to "flatsim"
   - Changed session naming from "multiverse_session_" to "flatsim_session_"
   - Updated examples to use "flatsim" branding

4. **Build System:**
   - CMakeLists.txt already properly configured with "flatsim" project name
   - All build variables use FLATSIM_ prefix consistently
   - Project exports and install targets use "flatsim" namespace

**Result:** Complete naming consistency with "flatsim" as the canonical project name and "fs" as the namespace.

### Example Update
- Updated main example to include a tractor alongside oxbo harvesters
- Changed one robot from `oxbo_harvester` to `tractor` with green coloring
