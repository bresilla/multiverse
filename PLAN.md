   - Renamed directories: `src/robot/chasis/` → `src/robot/chassis/`
   - Updated all file names, include paths, and references

2. **Member Variable Cleanup:**
   - Removed "z" suffix: `wheelz` → `wheels`, `controlz` → `controls`, `jointz` → `joints`
   - Fixed all related variables: `karosseriez` → `karosseries`, `hitchz` → `hitches`

3. **Case Convention Standardization:**
   - Standardized to **snake_case** throughout codebase
   - Fixed camelCase variables: `maxImpulse` → `max_impulse`, `wheelRadius` → `wheel_radius`

### Point 3.3: Section Control System (COMPLETED - Major Feature)
**Complete implementation of advanced section-based work area control:**

1. **Core Architecture:**
   - Created new `Section` class in `include/flatsim/robot/chassis/section.hpp`
   - Each section represents an individual controllable work unit
   - Sections automatically divide karosserie width equally based on configuration
   - Independent working state per section with visual feedback

2. **Configuration System:**
   - Modified `KaroserieInfo` struct: replaced `bool controllable` with `int sections`
   - Default `sections = 0` for non-working parts (hitches, mounts)
   - Working karosseries configured with `sections = 5` for precision control
   - Backward compatibility maintained for existing machine definitions

3. **Control Methods Implemented:**
   - `toggle_section_work(karosserie_name, section_id)` - Individual section control
   - `toggle_all_sections_work(karosserie_name)` - Toggle all sections simultaneously
   - `toggle_all_except_section_work(karosserie_name, except_id)` - Toggle all except specified section
   - Available at Robot, Chassis, and Simulator levels for maximum flexibility

4. **Visualization Enhancements:**
   - Sections render as **solid boxes when working**, **wireframe when idle**
   - Non-sectioned karosseries show only structural visualization
   - Each section has independent visualization path in Rerun hierarchy
   - Real-time working state feedback for operator awareness

5. **Layer Integration:**
   - Updated simulator to paint individual working sections to field layers
   - Only active sections contribute to field work operations
   - Precise area control for agricultural operations
   - Removed deprecated whole-karosserie painting for non-sectioned parts

   - Direct robot access: `robot.toggle_all_sections_work("front")`
   - Simulator access: `sim->toggle_section_work(robot_id, "front", 2)`
   - Removed deprecated `toggle_work()` methods throughout codebase
   - Clean separation: only sectioned karosseries can perform work

7. **Example Application Updates:**
   - Updated `mvs.cpp` to demonstrate section control functionality
   - Joystick button mapping for section control testing
   - Real-world usage examples for precision agriculture scenarios

**Impact:** This implementation enables **precision agriculture simulation** with granular control over work implement activation, supporting realistic agricultural machinery operation patterns.
